NOTES
=====

  It is possible to make the ext3 filesystem reliable across power
  failures for some hard disk types. To do this, add the barrier=1
  mount option to the appropriate entry in /etc/fstab. To check if
  the disk drive supports this option, run hdparm on the applicable
  disk drive. For example, if:

  $ hdparm -I /dev/sda | grep NCQ

  returns non-empty output, the option is supported.

  Note, that Logical Volume Management (LVM) based partitions cannot
  use the barrier option.
